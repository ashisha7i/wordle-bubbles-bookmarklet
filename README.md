Tested on:
- Chrome
- Slack (should work on clients that render `:white_circle:`, `:large_yellow_circle:` and `:large_green_circle:` correctly)
- Unauthenticated flow (should work for Authenticated users too but haven't tested it yet)

## Steps to Install

- Add a Bookmark to your browser 
- Choose any name you like (I chose `Worbbles`)
- Put the code from [bookmarklet.min.js](script/bookmarklet.min.js) in the `URL` field (see screenshot below)

Now you can click on the created bookmark(let) to execute the script and copy the current board to clipboard.

Click Away and have fun!! üñ±Ô∏è
