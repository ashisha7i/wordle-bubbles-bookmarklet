Tested on:
- Chrome
- Unauthenticated flow (should work for Authenticated users too but haven't tested it yet)

## Steps to Install

- Add a Bookmark to your browser 
- Choose any name you like (I chose `Worbbles`)
- Put the code from [bookmarklet-minified.js](bookmarklet-minified.js) in the `URL` field (see screenshot below)
- Click on the created bookmark to copy the current board to clipboard.
