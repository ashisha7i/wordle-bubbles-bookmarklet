**Example:**

**How it works?**
- Gets the game data from `localStorage`
- Iterates over the game boxes and generates the text like below:
```
Wordle 643 4/6

:white_circle::white_circle::white_circle::white_circle::large_green_circle:
:white_circle::large_green_circle::white_circle::white_circle::white_circle:
:white_circle::large_yellow_circle::large_yellow_circle::white_circle::white_circle:
:large_green_circle::large_green_circle::large_green_circle::large_green_circle::large_green_circle:
```

- Copies the text (shown above) to the clipboard using `navigator.clipBoard` API

**Tested on:**
- Chrome
- Slack (should work on clients that render `:white_circle:`, `:large_yellow_circle:` and `:large_green_circle:` correctly)
- Unauthenticated flow (should work for Authenticated users too but haven't tested it yet)

## Steps to Install

- Add a Bookmark to your browser 
- Choose any name you like (I chose `Worbbles`)
- Put the code from [bookmarklet.min.js](script/bookmarklet.min.js) in the `URL` field (see screenshot below)

Now you can click on the created bookmark(let) to execute the script and copy the current board to clipboard.

Click Away and have fun!! üñ±Ô∏è
